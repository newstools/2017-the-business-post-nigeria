 Inaugurated alongside Kembo Mohadi Ayuba Iliya | Friday, 29 December 2017  10:48am  | news Zimbabwe’s former army chief Constantino Chiwenga,who led the ouster of former president Robert Mugabe, has on Thursday been sworn-in as vice president to President Emmerson Mnangawa alongside long serving state security minister,Kembo Mohadi . Chiwenga’s appointment may not come as a surprise given his role in the de facto coup that led to the removal of Mugabe after 37 years rule. Mugabe’s decades-long grip on power was dramatically weakened as the military led by Chiwenga blocked roads outside the parliament in Harare and senior soldiers delivered a late-night television address to the nation about two months ago. The military intervention is believed to have paved way for President Mnangawa who became Zimbabwe’s president, weeks after he was sacked as vice president to Mugabe. Sworn in by Chief Justice Luke Malaba at Zimbabwe’s state house, Chiwenga’s appointment is the latest in a string of military leaders to be elevated to government positions. It’s been reported that his elevation to the number two post was preceded by his appointment as one of the two deputies to Mnangagwa in ZANU-PF, the ruling party. Recall that two other top military officials were earlier this month awarded ministerial posts. They were Sibusio Moyo, the current foreign affairs minister who announced the military take over on a state television and Perence Shiri who was former air force chief, now the Lands and Agriculture minister.
