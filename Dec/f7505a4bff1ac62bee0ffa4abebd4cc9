 Reconciliatory efforts may be failing Ayuba Iliya | Tuesday, 19 December 2017  9:53am  | politics The People’s Democratic Party, PDP might be in for another season of unending court battles as one of the chairmanship aspirants at the national convention of the party, Taoheed Adedoja, seeks nullification of the recently concluded elective convention in court. In a suit filed at the federal high court, Abuja on Monday, Adedoja seeks the courts intervention on the grounds that he was “excluded” from the exercise. He argues that rather than using his name, the convention planning committee used “Taoheed Oladoja” and as such, his name did not appear on the ballot papers. According to the suit filed by his lawyer, Adedoja claims that it was wrong to say he scored no voter in the election when his name was “missing.” The PDP convention was marred by what some members of the party consider as a deliberate attempt to side-line some geopolitical zones in the election, particularly the south west. At least seven chairmanship candidates saw the process as pre-arrange by some governors, thus stepping down from the race. They include; Chief Bode George, former Deputy National Chairman; Gbenga Daniel, Rasheed Ladoja, erstwhile Governors of Ogun and Oyo States, respectively, and Jimi Agbaje, PDP governorship candidate in Lagos State in 2015 elections. Professor Tunde Adeniran and Raymond Dokpesi, who remained in the race rejected the outcome of the election, ahead of the voting, warning about the consequences to the party. Although the National reconciliation committee of the party led by Governor of Bayelsa state, Seriake Dickson has since embarked on what appears to be a redemption mission, the effort maybe death on arrival as members begin to approach the courts.
