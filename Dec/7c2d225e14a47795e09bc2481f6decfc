has also disclosed that two officials of the commission have been summarily
dismissed, with a compulsory retirement of an Electoral Officer following their
involvement in the alleged double registration of the Kogi state governor,
Yahaya Bello in the continuous voter registration. Recall that the
Commission set up a panel of investigation into the involvement of staff in the
matter, which came up with recommendations. While the Governor of
Kogi State currently enjoys immunity from prosecution, the Commission said it
took the decision in respect of its own staff.
